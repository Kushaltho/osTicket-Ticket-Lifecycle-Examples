<h3>Intake</h3>

First make some tickets as end users via http://localhost/osTicket/. Login in through the credentials you had made for the users in the last part.

For example Zuquan might have been getting lots of reports of 404 errors.

Create two more tickets out of the help topics like Personal Computer Issues ,General Inquiry, Equipment Request, Password reset. Can also use different users.

<h3>Assignment and Communication</h3>

Now we are going to go through the tickets as an agent.

Go back to the agent panel using this link http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php with the credentials you made for the agent.

Now our job as an agent would be to make sure that the tickets have the appropriate agent/worker and SLA/priority in the order of when it came.

If it can be resolved by the agent looking though the ticket then they can assing it to themself.

Since an entire deparament's work is impeded the assingments should be high. And we will assing another agent for this ticket.
